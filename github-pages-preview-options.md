# GitHub Pages Preview URLs: Current State and Alternatives

## TL;DR

**GitHub Pages does not natively support preview URLs for pull requests or branches.** However, there are several workarounds and alternative solutions available.

## Current GitHub Pages Limitations

### What GitHub Pages Supports
- **Single branch deployment**: GitHub Pages can only deploy from one branch at a time (typically `main` or `gh-pages`)
- **Custom GitHub Actions workflows**: You can use GitHub Actions to build and deploy, but still limited to one live URL per repository
- **Branch switching**: You can manually change which branch GitHub Pages deploys from in repository settings

### What GitHub Pages Does NOT Support
- ❌ Automatic preview URLs for pull requests
- ❌ Multiple simultaneous deployments from different branches
- ❌ Native branch-based preview environments
- ❌ Ephemeral preview URLs that auto-cleanup when PRs are closed

## Workarounds for GitHub Pages

### 1. Manual Subdirectory Approach
**Concept**: Deploy different branches to subdirectories of your main site.

**Implementation**:
- Deploy `main` branch to root: `username.github.io/repo/`
- Deploy PR branches to: `username.github.io/repo/preview/PR-123/`
- Use GitHub Actions to manage the subdirectory structure

**Example Repository**: [grayside/gh-page-previews](https://github.com/grayside/gh-page-previews)

**Pros**:
- Uses only GitHub Pages
- Can automatically comment on PRs with preview links
- Automatic cleanup when PRs are closed

**Cons**:
- Complex GitHub Actions workflow required
- All previews share the same domain
- Potential conflicts with relative paths
- Manual subdirectory management

### 2. Custom GitHub Actions with Environments
**Concept**: Use GitHub Actions environments to create deployment URLs.

**Implementation**:
```yaml
environment:
  name: preview-${{ github.event.number }}
  url: ${{ steps.deployment.outputs.page_url }}
```

**Pros**:
- Integrates with GitHub's deployment system
- Can track deployment history
- Environment-specific secrets and variables

**Cons**:
- Still limited to one active GitHub Pages deployment
- Requires complex workflow orchestration
- Not truly ephemeral

### 3. Branch-Based Deployment Strategy
**Concept**: Deploy each branch to a separate repository or subdirectory.

**Tools**: 
- `gh-pages` npm package with `--add` flag
- `cleanup-gh-pages-previews` for automatic cleanup

**Example workflow**:
```yaml
- name: Deploy to subdirectory
  run: |
    BRANCH=${GITHUB_HEAD_REF##*/}
    DEST=$([ "$BRANCH" == "main" ] && echo "." || echo "preview/$BRANCH")
    npx gh-pages --add --dest $DEST --dist build/
```

## Alternative Solutions (Recommended)

### 1. Netlify Deploy Previews ⭐

- Automatic cleanup when PR is closed
- Custom domains supported
- Branch deploys for ongoing feature branches

**Setup**:
1. Connect your GitHub repository to Netlify
2. Deploy Previews are enabled by default
3. Every PR gets a unique URL automatically

**Pricing**: Free tier available, paid plans for advanced features

### 2. Vercel Preview Deployments
**Features**:
- Automatic preview URLs for every push/PR
- Custom domains and environments
- Built-in collaboration tools
- Automatic cleanup
- Framework-specific optimizations

**Setup**:
1. Connect GitHub repository to Vercel
2. Preview deployments work out of the box
3. Each PR gets a unique URL

**Pricing**: Free tier available, paid plans for teams

### 3. Surge.sh with GitHub Actions
**Features**:
- Simple static site hosting
- Custom domains
- Can be integrated with GitHub Actions for automated deployments

**Setup**:
```yaml
- name: Deploy to Surge
  run: |
    npm install -g surge
    surge --project ./build --domain pr-${{ github.event.number }}-yoursite.surge.sh
```

### 4. AWS S3 + CloudFront with GitHub Actions
**Features**:
- Full control over deployment process
- Can create/destroy preview environments
- Cost-effective for high-traffic sites

**Setup**: Requires custom GitHub Actions workflow to:
1. Create S3 bucket for each PR
2. Deploy static files
3. Configure CloudFront distribution
4. Cleanup on PR close

### 5. GitHub Actions + External Hosting
**Options**:
- **Firebase Hosting**: Preview channels supported
- **Azure Static Web Apps**: Automatic pull request environments
- **Cloudflare Pages**: Branch previews available

## Recommendations

### For Simple Projects
- **Use Netlify**: Most straightforward solution with excellent free tier
- **Use Vercel**: Great for React/Next.js projects

### For Complex Projects
- **Netlify or Vercel**: Still the best options due to built-in collaboration tools
- **Custom GitHub Actions + AWS/Azure**: For enterprise needs with specific requirements

### For GitHub Pages Enthusiasts
- **Subdirectory approach**: If you must stay on GitHub Pages, use the manual subdirectory method
- **Consider migration**: The benefits of dedicated preview platforms often outweigh the complexity of GitHub Pages workarounds

## Migration Considerations

### From GitHub Pages to Preview Platforms

**Pros of switching**:
- Native PR preview support
- Better collaboration tools
- Automatic cleanup
- Often better performance
- More deployment options

**Cons of switching**:
- Need to update DNS/domain settings
- Learn new platform
- Potential costs for advanced features
- Migration effort

### Keeping GitHub Pages
**When to stay**:
- Simple static sites with minimal collaboration needs
- Strong preference for staying within GitHub ecosystem
- Custom domain already set up with GitHub Pages
- No budget for paid hosting

## Current Best Practices (2024)

1. **For new projects**: Start with Netlify or Vercel for built-in preview support
2. **For existing GitHub Pages sites**: Evaluate migration vs. implementing subdirectory workaround
3. **For teams**: Use platforms with built-in collaboration tools (Netlify, Vercel)
4. **For enterprises**: Consider custom GitHub Actions with cloud providers for full control

## Future Outlook

GitHub has not announced plans to add native preview URL support to GitHub Pages. The platform seems focused on simple, single-branch deployments. For preview functionality, external platforms remain the best solution.
